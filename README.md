# Digisafe: A Smart Locker Based System

Digisafe is an IoT-based system that uses **Arduino**, **JavaScript**, and **PHP**. It allows users to generate dynamic QR codes to scan and open a physical locker.

This system is developed and intended for company-based access where there is an already existing account and an SSO (Single Sign-On) improvement is desired. It contains both user and admin side features.
